# Lilla M. Gurtner

With my research, I bridge the gap between Psychology and Transformation Sciences: What might future societies look like? How can we get there? Which psychological properties of humans are currently in the way, and how might we harness them to transform societies towards more sustainable forms of social provisioning?

As a Post-doctoral researcher at the [Centre for Development and Environment](https://www.cde.unibe.ch/about_us/personen/dr_gurtner_lilla/index_eng.html) of the University of Bern, I investigate these questions as part of the [Commonpaths Project](https://commonpaths.unibe.ch/). In addition to that, I am module leader in the module "Personal development and complementary studies" in the [Master in Sustainability Transformations](https://www.cde.unibe.ch/studies/master_in_sustainability_transformations/index_eng.html).

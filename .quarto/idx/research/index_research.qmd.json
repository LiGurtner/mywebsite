It brings together researchers from Switzerland, Ghana, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria to explore urban commons and their contribution to sustainability.  \n\n#### What are “ urban commons”? {.unnumbered} \n\nWe define “urban commons” as a resource that is self-managed by a community of users in an urban setting. One example for urban commons are housing cooperatives that operate on a cost-rent basis. These cooperatives provide affordable housing possibilities without a profit imperative. Other examples include community-supported agriculture or urban gardening initiatives, who provide local and seasonal food and often operate with agroecological principles in mind.  \n\nThe Commonpaths-Project focuses on how these commons can help reduce our reliance on market-driven systems for provisioning of (essential) goods such as housing, food, and green spaces, a process known as de-commodification. As part of the \"Behavioural perspective-WP\", I investigate the role of trust, self-efficacy and norms/values in the self-organizing activities of commoners. \n\n\n----\n\n## Rethinkig statistics\n\nTogether with two PhD-students from the Commonpaths-Project, we are in the process of going through Richard McElreath's \"Rethinking statistics\" and publish brms-tidyverse-ish solutions to his exercises [here](https://ligurtner.github.io/Rethinking_exercises/Home.html)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":false,"reference-location":"margin","output-file":"index_research.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","fontsize":"1.1em","theme":["pulse","../html/styles.scss"],"anchor-sections":true,"fig-cap-location":"margin","footnotes-hover":true,"title":"Projects"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
